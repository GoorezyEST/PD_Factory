# Factory

The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides a way to create objects through an interface defined in a superclass and altered by subclasses. 

This pattern is useful for creating objects based on input or conditions and allows for encapsulating object creation logic in separate classes for better maintainability and reusability.
